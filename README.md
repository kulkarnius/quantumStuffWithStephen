You can actually clone this repository onto your machine and run it yourself to change parameters and work it yourself. I can build in the ease of use later down the road as required to make it that you can run everything from command line very quickly as needed.

There are quite a few mistakes currently. You can see those mistakes in the issues that I have opened. Once I fix all of the them, it should work fine.
